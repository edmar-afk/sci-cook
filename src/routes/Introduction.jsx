        Ingredients are the foundation of every dish, influencing flavor,
        texture, and nutritional value. In Grade 8 Cookery, students are
        expected to identify and select ingredients for egg dishes, vegetable
        dishes, salads, sandwiches, starch dishes, and desserts. While the MELCs
        outline these competencies, they do not provide detailed content such as
        scientific names, images, or multimedia support. 
        
        <br/><br/>
        This QR-coded
        instructional material bridges that gap by providing students with
        images, scientific names, brief descriptions, and video/audio links for
        each ingredient. It enhances ingredient recognition, supports practical
        cooking skills, and promotes interactive and independent learning
        aligned with the MELCs.
